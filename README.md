Carbonite.Notes

--Rythal--

I am in the process of compiling all of the treasure and rare locations into a Carbonite.Notes addon.
So far only a few lines into it, after spending the day reading your code and trying to understand, 
what does what and what goes where and such. I have tested the first few lines and it seems to be working.
Now I know it isn't as complex as I would like it to be, but that xml will be for a future date. Right now 
it just marks the locations of treasures with coin (9) symbol and rares with skull (8) symbol. I want to 
eventually design an xml where onFind and onCollect will record and remove the icon from current profile
(player). I'm a 35 yr old Retired Disabled Vet, so I sit at home with my 4 yr old and play wow.
